# mythbusters-data

While the Mythbusters get a lot of things right in a scientific approach on their show, they consistently tend to quote isolated averages and draw conclusions from them. Occasionally, they will display raw data on the screen, allowing us to do a more nuanced analysis.

This repository harvests data sets from the Mythbusters show with the intent to use the data collected in statistics education. The ambition is to gather as raw data as possible.

Repository is organized as [Season]/[Episode]/datasetname.csv with comma-separated values.
