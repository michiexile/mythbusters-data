# mythbusters-data

While the Mythbusters get a lot of things right in a scientific approach on their show, they consistently tend to quote isolated averages and draw conclusions from them. Occasionally, they will display raw data on the screen, allowing us to do a more nuanced analysis.

This repository harvests data sets from the Mythbusters show with the intent to use the data collected in statistics education. The ambition is to gather as raw data as possible.

Repository is organized as [Season]/[Episode]/datasetname.csv with comma-separated values.

## 12x5

10 men and 10 women were asked to navigate a car trip by using a printed paper map. They were scored on a scale from 0 to 100: starting with 100 points and losing points for a variety of navigation issues.

## 13x4

10 volunteers smell two sweat samples - sampled from sweat created by fear or by exercise. Out of four options (both fear, A fear, B fear, none fear) volunteers picked one. Dataset has information on whether their guess was correct or not.
